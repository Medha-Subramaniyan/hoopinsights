A small mini-project to practice PostgreSQL to Tableau workflow using player performance data from the NBA (2014–2015) and WNBA (2016–2017).

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Practice SQL fundamentals: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`
- Analyze real-world sports data
- Visualize player stats for insights
